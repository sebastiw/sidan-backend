# sidan-backend

## How to run

`make`: start database locally

`go run src/sidan-backend.go`: start service locally

The service should connect automatically to the local database. To
change configfile (from the default `config/local.yaml`), you can set
the `CONFIG_FILE` env parameter pointing to an the new config-file.

## Structure

under `/`:
- `db/`: database migrations
- `static/`: static files served by (for instance) `file` endpoint.
- `config/`: different configs for different cases.
- `apis/`: files defining old and new apis.
- code under `src/`:
  - `src/router/`: defines the endpoints
  - `src/database/`: defines models and database apis.
  - `src/config/`: define and parses the config

## Old APIs

http://chalmerslosers.com:9000/service-inspector/Clac3

Download wsdl to `apis/Clac3.xml`, then run `node wsdl_to_swagger.js`
to generate the swagger yaml.
