Normal kräftskivekonsumtion av alkohol.

Författarens sambo konstaterade att det inte fanns några tvivel om att dennes berusningsnivå kvällen innan var av en nivå som tidigare föranlett fosterställning, snabbantning och ångestdusch.\r\n\r\nSlutsats:\r\nUnderlaget är för litet för att dra några slutsatser, men den här preliminära studien tyder på att det finns fog att fortsätta utvärdera metoden.','2020-08-30','12:16:39');
